# Purpose
    This is a program to scrape product price from a website called bunnings warehouse

# Caution.
    This is the first time I make a window application as well as first time webscraping, therefor, use at your own discreation.

    Obviously, the program failure to run will not in any capacity affect your system.

# When using
    Every new scrape, whether schedule run or manual run will completely erase previous entry in the CSV files. So if you want to keep a particular item, it would be best if you don't delete the URL inside webpath.txt.

    Only delete it if you no longer care about the item.

# First Run
    When first runnning the program, if you want to allow the application to auto run, run the script install_service.bat as administrator

# Using the program.
    You can manualy use the program by click BunningsScraper.exe or runonce.bat
